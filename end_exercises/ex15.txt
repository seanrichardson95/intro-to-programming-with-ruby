What will the following program output?
hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

if hash1 == hash2
  puts "These hashes are the same!"
else
  puts "These hashes are not the same!"
end

My answer:
The program will output "These hashes are the same!" because the
orders of each hash do not matter.

LS answer:
These hashes are the same!
