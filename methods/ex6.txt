What does the following error message tell you?

ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
  

The message tells me that not enough arguments were used in the method call. One argument was used when there should've been two.
