What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

My answer:
Exception handling is using a "begin" "rescue" "end" structure to your code
that allows your code to continue running when there is an error.

This can also be helpful for determining where the error is.

It is often used when your program is interacting with the unpredictable outside world, allowing it
to run even when it comes across an error.

LS answer:
Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error occurring in a program. 
It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.
