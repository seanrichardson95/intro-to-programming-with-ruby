What will the following program print to the screen? What will it return?
def execute(&block)
  block
end

execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }

My answer:
It will output "Hello from inside the execute method!"

Correct answer:
Nothing is printed to the screen because the block is never activated with the .call method. The method returns a Proc object.
