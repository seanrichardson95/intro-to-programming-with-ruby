Why does the following code...
def execute(block)
  block.call
end

execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }

Give us the following error when we run it?
block.rb1:in `execute': wrong number of arguments (0 for 1) (ArgumentError)
from test.rb:5:in `<main>'

My answer:
The method parameter should be (&block), instead it is (block).

LS answer:
The method parameter block is missing the ampersand sign & that allows a block to be passed as a parameter.
